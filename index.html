                    Imagine this scenario: I walk up to the counter at a fast-food restaurant, and place an order for a cheeseburger. I hand the cashier $1.47. By placing my order and paying for it, I've made a request for a value back (the cheeseburger). I've started a transaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But often, the cheeseburger is not immediately available for me. The cashier hands me something in place of my cheeseburger: a receipt with an order number on it. This order number is an IOU ("I owe you") promise that ensures that eventually, I should receive my cheeseburger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I hold onto my receipt and order number. I know it represents my future cheeseburger, so I don't need to worry about it anymore -- aside from being hungry!
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I wait, I can do other things, like send a text message to a friend that says, "Hey, can you come join me for lunch? I'm going to eat a cheeseburger."
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am reasoning about my future cheeseburger already, even though I don't have it in my hands yet. My brain is able to do this because it's treating the order number as a placeholder for the cheeseburger. The placeholder essentially makes the value time independent. It's a future value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, I hear, "Order 113!" and I gleefully walk back up to the counter with receipt in hand. I hand my receipt to the cashier, and I take my cheeseburger in return.
